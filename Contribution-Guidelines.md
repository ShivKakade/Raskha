# Contribution Guidelines

We love :heart: improvements to our project! To make it easy for new comers to contribute to this project, we have set following guidelines:

### Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

We have set up templates for both reporting bugs and requesting new features which will help to maintain a common standard for 
contribution. Before opening a ticket for your issue, the contributors should ensure that the issue is not reported in the past.     
However if the issue to be reported is similar to the previous issue, put comments in the previous issue only. Upon opening, the issue should be discussed first with mentors and other contributors and if found relevant on   discussion through [GitHub issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/), the contributor can start working on it if  he/she wants. 
  The issues will also be labelled with different tags to help you in selection of issue you are interested to solve.

### Submitting Code and Documentation Changes

Our process for accepting changes operates by [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and has a few steps:

1.  First of all clone this repo to your local device using the following command.

        $ git clone https://github.com/oss2019/instigo-android
   
1.  Create a **new branch** for the changes you want to work on. Choose a topic for your branch name that reflects the change:

        $ git checkout -b <branch-name>

1.  **Create or modify the files** with your changes. If you want to show other people work that isn't ready to merge in, commit your changes then create a pull request (PR) with _WIP_ or _Work In Progress_ in the title.

1.  Once your changes are ready for final review, commit your changes then modify or **create your pull request (PR)**, assign as a reviewer or ping (using "`@<username>`") a Lieutenant (someone able to merge in PRs) active on the project.
Make sure to squash all your commits. Here is a doc to help you to [squash](https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/How-to-squash-commits).

1.  Allow others sufficient **time for review and comments** before merging. We make use of GitHub's review feature to comment in-line on PRs when possible. There may be some fixes or adjustments you'll have to make based on feedback.

1.  Once you have integrated comments, or waited for feedback, a Lieutenant should merge your changes in!:smiley:
